Reinventing the wheel (My Own Library)

This is a personal project of mine. Sure - we're making our own Library at WeThinkCode called lib42, but is it really my own if I was told which functions to make (of which several are quite limited in its current state, but with some tweaking could be made handy in a real-life situation) and how to make it.

I'm hoping this will sharpen my knowledge as I enjoy my vacation(2 weeks) coding ^^.
although if past experiences have taught me anything about myself it's that I have NO persistance when there is no NEED to do something. as they say "Time that is not filled, will fill itself" *cough* anime *cough*. But my ceaseless naievety has always been stronger than the doubt in myself. SO LETS DO THIS.
